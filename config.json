    "preamble": "Welcome to the Grill, a Q&A-style town hall for all things Charcoal!\nIf you haven't participated here before, the format is fairly simple:\n- people get in line to ask questions here: https://charcoal-grill.herokuapp.com\n- we'll turn the room into a gallery to let the user ask their question uninterrupted\n- a Charcoal member will give a concise, canonical answer\n- we'll open up the room to all for some additional discussion before moving on to the next question\nThe session will start in about 15 minutes, so save a spot in line and start formulating your question :)\nFinally, as a friendly reminder to any moderators here: we'd appreciate it if you'd refrain from talking when the room is in gallery mode so as to allow whomever is asking the next question a chance to speak without interruption :)",
